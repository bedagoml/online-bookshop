						<h2> About Us</h2>
						<p> One reason for this is that they help us build upon the combined experience of many developers <br /> that came before us and ensure we structure our code in an <br />optimized way, meeting the needs of problems we're attempting to solve.
						Design patterns also provide us a common vocabulary to describe solutions. This can be significantly simpler than describing syntax and semantics when we're attempting to convey a way of structuring a solution in code form to others.<hr>
